This project aims to create an efficient and optimized system for storing and searching through Netflix's extensive catalog of movies and TV shows.

Our goal is to develop data structures that allow for quick and easy access to the information contained in the dataset, making it easy for users to search for their favorite titles and discover new content.

To achieve this, we will be using a variety of advanced techniques, including state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures. Whether you're a Netflix enthusiast looking to learn more about the platform's catalog, or a developer looking to contribute to the project, we welcome you to join us and help make this project a success!
